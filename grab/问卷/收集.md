ops：
	bup和myc的格式不统一，导致bup数据不方便


Muddassir Iqbal, Engineering manager:
	There are some redundancies, like Ops tools and KartaPlace Portal are solving similar problems. The
	close loop for a POI is missing, who generated it, where it is used, is it accepted and rejected and is there
	any updates in the past.
	冗余：
	Ops tools for POI: from submission to production every step. and then each update record. It is hard to
	find right now.
