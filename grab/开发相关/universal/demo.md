First of all, for this part of the review, if you choose not to agree. Then subsequent forms sections are not shown. It is important to note that OPS can also independently determine whether the data is correct. For other parts, when we select agree, we will automatically fill in the collected data by default. For coordinate auditing, when the form is filled, the map on the right side shows the corresponding marker that can be dragged and dropped. For street auditing, normalized is directly enabled in the current version. The form section is also adjusted for different countries. Different combinations of street names are displayed depending on the country. Here is the image review. Different from the previous verify place, we require ops to review each image, and the background will score according to the image review results. The area code of the phone number will change according to the country, of course, the prefix is only for display.
