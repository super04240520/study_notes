we'll add various options in the feature.

Let's enter the review page. Currently, Ops needs to review the current results. 

Ops need to review whether the POI exists. Here we have two options. When 'Disagree' is selected, it means that the current POI does not exist and all subsequent submissions do not require review. 

Let's select 'Agree' to proceed with subsequent review. It should be noted that Ops mainly use their judgment of data accuracy to determine whether payment should be made to collectors and verifiers. 

When 'Agree' is selected, the collector's submission will automatically be populated. Each part will take the current reviewer's submission as the final result. 

For location, after the reviewer enters or auto-fills the coordinates, a marker will be displayed on the map, which the reviewer can drag to find the correct location.

currently, the workflow is the normalization of the 'street'. This will be the same as the poi create edit page. The data collection section will be assembled according to the address model of different countries and the form below will automatically adjust according to the country. 

The new workflow requires Ops to review each image. As before, there are several categories of images here. 

When 'Bad Photo' is selected, you need to select the reason for the error.
If you find a review error, you can hit 'Redo' to review again.
The form section works as described above.
Next is the review of the entire task. When different review types are selected, the reviewer needs to select different submission reasons.
Here, we have added some of the reviewed models, such as fraud and some others. That's pretty much it. If anyone has any questions, please ask. That's pretty much all. If anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask.
