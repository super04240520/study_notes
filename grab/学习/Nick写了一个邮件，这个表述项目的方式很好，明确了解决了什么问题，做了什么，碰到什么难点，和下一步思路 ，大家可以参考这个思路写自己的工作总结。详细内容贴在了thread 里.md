Background  
Grab secured a multi million dollar partnership with MSFT to power their mapping services including Bing Maps in SouthEast Asia. In this deal, we are a data provider meaning our GrabMaps content is consumed by MSFT to create their own services like routing, map tiles and search.What we did  
We worked in close collaboration with the MSFT product and engineering teams to get our portfolio in a ready state to launch and make MSFT maps more competitive in SEA. While it was challenging at times, making interoperability work across two very different companies, we have learned a lot and gained valuable insights about how we take our B2B business to the next level.Over the last 10 months our highly empowered team within Geo rallied to address data gaps, innovate new features and accelerate development to support this partnership.Some of our highlights are:

- **Expanded attribute coverage by +78,000 km** that will help MSFT customers and Grab DAX to find their way across SEA
- **Adjusted road hierarchy in 64 cities** to make routing more accurate and efficient (also improving TPTH)
- **Added +4400 km of access restrictions on narrow roads** to reduce poor routes for 4w trips, again improving efficiency for DAX along the way.
- **+5.5 million address points added or improved** for better destination search.

What we learned  

1. Evaluating millions of points of interest or kilometers of roads against reality is impossible for MSFT teams based in the US and so they often resort to comparing against other map providers (which is not reality!). **Relaying the local nuances and conditions and also customer centric benchmarking was critical to build confidence in our product**.
2. Working as a **small and empowered team connecting frequently with the customer** (2x per week) helped us to be laser focussed on what we needed to deliver and react quickly when we ran into issues.
3. **Stakeholder management** is challenging when working with a big organization like MSFT. Product, engineering, BD and leadership all pulled together to help get alignment and focus on the now as well as bigger picture.
4. We have learned a lot about supporting B2B sales. There is still room for improvement but in terms of foundational product features, delivery, comms and customer support we are **significantly better set up for success at scale now**.

Whats next  
While we have wrapped up the critical blockers and successfully launched on Bing Maps there’s still work to be done. From here our goal is to become Microsoft’s primary data partner in SEA (launching Places and Traffic) and support them in creating a differentiated experience and help them become the premium platform of choice for SEA for consumers and developers via [Azure Maps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-maps#:~:text=Azure%20Maps%20is%20a%20suite,%2D%20and%20web%2Dbased%20apps.).Looking more broadly at B2B, with this experience, our portfolio is in a much better place to take advantage of future opportunities. Microsoft adds another marquee customer to our growing list. We are excited to promote this externally and push forward with our ambitious goals for GrabMaps.
