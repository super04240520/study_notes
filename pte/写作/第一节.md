如何刷刷题
1,课后作业：完成WE提交至群内：
 It is claimed that it is increasingly difficult to keep the right balance between work and other aspects of one's life such as leisure pursuits with family members. How important do you think this balance is and why do some people consider it hard to achieve?
在工作和生活的其他方面(如与家人的休闲活动)之间保持适当的平衡越来越难了。你认为这种平衡有多重要?为什么有些人认为它很难实现?

working hard / home. 
平衡有多重要?:
	 work: work hard
	health,  spend more time to play with my family.  more happiness,
	 
positive:
	 
为什么有些人认为它很难实现? 

the people who have no choice.  the harder you work, the more you earn

Obviously, It is undoubtedly the cast that keep the right balance between work and other aspects of one's life  played a vital role in our society, and the statement that (标题: 主谓) has attracted  much attention from the public. As far as I am concerned,  I believe that a sagacious person ought to pay attention to ___名次

First and foremost, there are plenty of reasons why I believe that we should focus on (名词). which is an exceedingly potent argument. Nobody can deny the simple fact that if we emphasize(名词),the world will be perfect. Aa a matter of fact, based on my own experience, we are supposed to maintain (名词) while others can stick with their own choices. Therefore, the perspective I mentioned above is valid.
